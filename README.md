# Top Songs
- Built using React, HTML, and CSS
- Visit Deployed Version - [Top Songs](https://top-songs-takehome.netlify.app/)

## Installation and Launch
- Use `npm install` in project's root directory to install dependencies
- run `npm start` to launch locally


## Notes
- I was unsure if I should render the list of top 10 songs with items that have repeated frequencies or only the first item of a specific frequency. I chose to render only the first item, however, if you look at lines 26-30 in App.js there are instructions on how to uncomment/comment the code to view top items with repeat frequencies
